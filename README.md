# PharmaHub-Android-Application
<h2>Details:</h2>
 Kotlin Jetpack Compose for building the interface of both the admin and user apps. SQLite is used to store the user details, list of
 medicines, stock details, and purchase history locally. Python Flask for creating APIs that allow the apps to interact with the server and
 manage data.
 Admin App: The admin app is used to manage all medicines in the store, including adding new medicines, updating stock levels, and
 removing outdated items. It tracks the stock for each medicine and also approves users to use the medical shop app.
 User App: Users can browse through the complete list of medicines, view their details, and check availability. They can place orders,
 view prices, and track their orders.
 Flask API: The Flask API connects both apps to a central database and handles tasks like Register users, Login Users, Block Users,
 Approve Users, medicine searches, and inventory updates.
